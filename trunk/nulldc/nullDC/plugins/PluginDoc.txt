Changelog (since 23/3/2006)
Updated 23/3/2006
-Started writing this doc. It's supposed to keep a documentation on how plugins should work 
(so i can find bugs on the loader-manager code ..)


The plugins have two type of interfaces , the common and the plugin type speciacific.

Posibble plugin types :
PowerVR
GDrom
AICA(contains and arm7)
MapleMain(Maple main devices , like joystick)
MapleSub (Maple sub devices , like VMU)

A Plugin has to implement the common interface , and has to implement one or more plugin type interfaces.
When a plugin implements many plugin type interfaces , the common init/reset/term is called once for 
each interface.A parameter is passed in order to easyly find for witch plugin interface the init/reset/term
is for.


Common plugin Interface :
Function : "dcGetInterfaceInfo" has to be exported exported from the dll
For more information about the params look at plugin_types.h(or plugin_header.h)
